Napkin
======

A simple S/W modeling tool describing models using Python language.

Basic idea is to *design* software by writing python programs.  It is like
writing psedo-code in python and the psedo-code can generate diagrams such as
sequence or class diagrams

Currently, it only supports sequence diagram and planUML output.

It can be installed with::

  $ pip install napkin
